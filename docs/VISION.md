# COALITION - Game Vision and Design Philosophy

## Core Vision

COALITION transforms the complex world of Dutch coalition politics into an engaging political simulation that balances authenticity with satirical commentary. Players experience the full political cycle from campaign promises to governing realities, learning that in Dutch democracy, compromise isn't just necessary—it's the only way to survive.

## Design Philosophy

### Authentic Simulation with Satirical Edge

**Realism First**: The game mechanics mirror real Dutch political processes—proportional representation forcing coalition government, lengthy formation negotiations, parliamentary procedures, and media dynamics that shape public opinion.

**Satirical Commentary**: While maintaining political authenticity, the presentation adopts a darkly humorous tone that exposes the absurdities and contradictions inherent in democratic coalition building. Think *Yes Minister*'s bureaucratic satire applied to *Borgen*'s coalition drama.

**No Sacred Cows**: The game portrays all political positions and parties with equal satirical treatment, avoiding partisan bias while highlighting universal political human nature.

### Player Agency vs. Systemic Pressure

**Meaningful Choices**: Players can frame issues, build coalitions, and pursue policies, but every action has consequences within a realistic political system.

**Systemic Constraints**: Like real politicians, players face constraints from coalition partners, opposition parties, media coverage, public opinion, and institutional procedures. Success requires working within these systems, not around them.

**Gradual Consequences**: Failure isn't instant game-over but gradual erosion of support, credibility, and coalition stability—reflecting how real political careers often end with whimpers rather than bangs.

## Narrative Framework

### The Player's Journey

**Starting Point**: A newly-elected politician from a smaller party (20-30 seats) with genuine intentions to solve real problems—housing crisis, climate change, immigration challenges, or economic inequality.

**Rising Action**: Navigate campaign promises vs. coalition realities, media scrutiny, party discipline, and voter expectations while trying to maintain personal integrity.

**Climax Options**:
- Successfully implement meaningful policy changes
- Become consumed by political gamesmanship
- Face resignation amid scandal or coalition collapse
- Architect a new political realignment

**Endings**: Multiple paths reflecting real political careers—graceful retirement, electoral defeat, scandal-driven resignation, or transformation into an elder statesman.

### Tone and Style

**Visual Style**: Clean, modern desktop interface with subtle satirical elements—app icons that gently mock political communication, notification sounds that emphasize the constant pressure, and UI elements that feel familiar yet absurd.

**Writing Style**: Sharp, observational humor that punches up at power structures rather than down at individuals. Characters speak in authentic political language—formal when necessary, calculated when strategic, and occasionally accidentally honest.

**Cultural References**: Deeply embedded Dutch political culture—coffee meetings, bicycle commutes, polder model consultations, and the particular Dutch approach to consensus building through exhaustive discussion.

## World Building

### The Netherlands as Political Laboratory

**Proportional Paradise**: The Dutch system's extreme proportionality (10+ parties typically represented) creates a perfect laboratory for coalition dynamics. No one governs alone; everyone must compromise.

**Issue Complexity**: Real Dutch political issues provide rich gameplay material:
- **Housing**: Young voters priced out vs. homeowner equity protection
- **Immigration**: Humanitarian obligations vs. integration capacity
- **Climate**: Ambitious goals vs. economic transition costs
- **Europe**: Sovereignty concerns vs. integration benefits
- **Economy**: Innovation leadership vs. inequality growth

**Regional Dynamics**: From progressive Amsterdam to conservative Bible Belt, from industrial Limburg to agricultural Groningen—different regions provide different electoral mathematics.

### Character Archetypes

**Party Leaders**: Based on recognizable Dutch political archetypes but fictionalized to avoid defamation:
- The Populist: Appeals to common frustrations but struggles with governing details
- The Technocrat: Policy expertise but limited emotional intelligence
- The Veteran: Institutional knowledge but resistance to change
- The Idealist: Clear vision but inflexible on compromise
- The Pragmatist: Skilled negotiator but unclear principles

**Media Figures**: Representing different outlets and approaches:
- Public Broadcasting: Attempts objectivity but faces political pressure
- Commercial Television: Entertainment value drives coverage decisions
- Quality Press: In-depth analysis but limited reach
- Tabloid Press: Sensationalism and scandal focus
- Social Media Influencers: Direct audience connection but platform dependency

## Gameplay Philosophy

### Simulation Depth vs. Accessibility

**Casual Mode**: Streamlined mechanics focusing on major decisions and dramatic moments, suitable for players interested in political narrative but not procedural complexity.

**Simulation Mode**: Full complexity of Dutch political procedures, detailed policy impact modeling, and realistic time constraints for players who want authentic political challenge.

**Adaptive Difficulty**: Game responds to player performance and preferences, providing more support for struggling players while increasing complexity for successful ones.

### Educational Value

**Civic Education**: Players learn how Dutch democracy actually functions—not just elections but the daily work of coalition management, parliamentary procedure, and policy implementation.

**Media Literacy**: Experiencing how the same events get framed differently by different outlets helps players understand media bias and manipulation in real life.

**Political Empathy**: Playing different party perspectives helps players understand why people hold different political views and how institutional constraints shape political behavior.

### Ethical Boundaries

**Satirical but Respectful**: Mock political behaviors and institutions without targeting individuals for personal characteristics or private lives.

**Educational Purpose**: Satirical content serves to illuminate political dynamics, not to promote cynicism or disengagement from democratic participation.

**Historical Awareness**: Handle sensitive topics (wartime collaboration, immigration tensions, religious divisions) with appropriate gravity while maintaining satirical approach to contemporary politics.
