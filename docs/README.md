# COALITION - Dutch Political Simulation

## Project Overview

COALITION is a satirical political simulation game set in the Netherlands, presented as a fictional desktop operating system with apps for political communication, coalition negotiations, and governance. Players navigate the complex world of Dutch coalition politics, from campaign through governing to potential collapse.

**Core Experience**: Start as a new politician, campaign on real issues, negotiate coalition agreements, manage crises, and either succeed in governing or face political downfall.

**Tone**: Serious political realism with satirical, darkly humorous undertones. Think *Borgen* meets *Yes Minister*.

## Key Features

### Desktop Simulation Interface
- Satirical OS shell with political apps
- Messaging, memos, coalition talks, news feeds
- Polling data and scandal management tools

### Coalition Politics Core Loop
- **Campaign**: Build platform, participate in debates, track polling
- **Formation**: Negotiate with informateurs, trade portfolios, handle crises
- **Governing**: Implement policies, manage scandals, maintain discipline
- **Crisis/Collapse**: Navigate votes of no confidence, resignations, new elections

### AI-Driven Social Media
- Dynamic responses from party archetypes, media figures, and public segments
- Realistic Dutch political discourse simulation
- Multiple media framing effects on public opinion

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Basic desktop OS interface with core apps
- [ ] Coalition formation mini-game with authentic Dutch mechanics
- [ ] Weekly time progression system
- [ ] Simple election mechanics
- [ ] Basic AI social media responses
- [ ] Save/continue functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Simulation (6-12 months)
- [ ] 3D debate stage events with choice consequences
- [ ] Deeper scandal and inquiry systems
- [ ] Committee and parliamentary procedures
- [ ] Cabinet reshuffles and defections
- [ ] Advanced media framing mechanics

### Phase 3: Extended Scope (12+ months)
- [ ] Provincial and municipal politics
- [ ] EU integration dynamics
- [ ] Historical scenarios and alternate timelines
- [ ] Multiplayer coalition negotiations
- [ ] Advanced AI personality systems

## Technical Foundation

**Primary Stack**: Godot 4.5 game engine for cross-platform desktop development
