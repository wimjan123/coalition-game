# COALITION - Ethics and Safety Guidelines

## Satirical Content Framework

### Core Principle: Punch Up, Not Down

**Institutional Satire**: Target political institutions, processes, and power structures rather than individuals' personal characteristics, backgrounds, or private lives.

**Power Dynamic Awareness**: Satirical treatment should reflect the power dynamics involvedâ€”criticize those with political power more harshly than private citizens or vulnerable groups.

**Educational Purpose**: All satirical content should serve to illuminate political dynamics, institutional failures, or democratic processes rather than promoting cynicism or disengagement.

### Acceptable Satirical Targets

#### Political Institutions and Processes
- **Coalition Formation**: The absurdly lengthy negotiation processes and bureaucratic complexity
- **Parliamentary Procedures**: The formal rituals, ceremonial aspects, and procedural constraints
- **Campaign Promises**: The gap between electoral rhetoric and governing reality
- **Media Relations**: The choreographed nature of political communication and spin
- **EU Integration**: The complex multi-level governance and sovereignty tensions

#### Political Behaviors and Archetypes
- **The Career Politician**: Ambition over principle, risk aversion, focus on electability
- **The Idealistic Newcomer**: Naive expectations meeting political reality
- **The Coalition Broker**: Treating politics as pure mathematics and deal-making
- **The Media Performer**: Politicians who prioritize optics over substance
- **The Backroom Operator**: Those who prefer influence without accountability

#### System Contradictions
- **Democratic vs. Technocratic**: Tensions between popular will and expert opinion
- **National vs. European**: Sovereignty concerns vs. integration benefits
- **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Electoral cycles vs. generational challenges
- **Coalition vs. Opposition**: Governing compromises vs. principled opposition

### Fictional Character Guidelines

#### Real Person Adaptations
**Archetype Preservation**: Maintain recognizable political archetypes while avoiding specific personal details or direct name usage.

**Composite Characters**: Combine traits from multiple real politicians to create fictional representatives of political positions rather than direct caricatures.

**Temporal Distance**: Historical figures (pre-2000) can be referenced more directly, recent figures require more careful fictionalization.

#### Party Representations
**Ideological Accuracy**: Fictional parties must accurately represent real ideological positions to maintain educational value.

**Name Differentiation**: Use clearly fictional party names while preserving recognizable ideological positioning.

**Internal Diversity**: Show internal party debates and factions rather than monolithic characterizations.

### Content Safety Standards

#### Prohibited Content
**Personal Attacks**: No content targeting politicians' physical appearance, family members, personal relationships, or private struggles unrelated to governance.

**Hate Speech**: No content promoting discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.

**Defamation**: No false factual claims about real people that could damage their reputation beyond fair political commentary.

**Doxxing**: No real personal information (addresses, phone numbers, private communications) even for public figures.

#### Sensitive Historical Topics
**World War II and Collaboration**: Handle with appropriate gravity while acknowledging how these events shape contemporary Dutch political discourse.

**Immigration and Integration**: Address policy debates while avoiding dehumanization or promotion of discrimination.

**Religious Divisions**: Respect religious perspectives while examining their role in political coalitions and policy positions.

**Regional Tensions**: Acknowledge rural-urban and regional divides without stereotyping or dismissing legitimate concerns.

### AI Content Moderation

#### Response Generation Guidelines
**Political Balance**: AI personas should reflect authentic political positions without promoting extremist ideologies.

**Hate Speech Prevention**: AI responses must be filtered to prevent generation of discriminatory or harmful content.

**Factual Accuracy**: AI should not generate false factual claims about real events, people, or policies.

**Context Awareness**: AI responses should reflect appropriate tone for serious topics while maintaining satirical game context.

#### Player Content Monitoring
**Community Standards**: Player-generated content (posts, messages) subject to community moderation standards.

**Reporting System**: Clear mechanisms for reporting inappropriate content with human review processes.

**Educational Context**: Enforcement considers educational satirical purpose vs. genuine harmful intent.

### Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines

#### Dutch Political Culture
**Consensus Tradition**: Respect the Dutch tradition of consensus-building while satirizing its sometimes absurd extremes.

**Directness vs. Politeness**: Acknowledge Dutch cultural directness while avoiding crude or unnecessarily offensive language.

**International Context**: Present Dutch politics within European and global contexts without promoting nationalism or isolationism.

#### Minority Representation
**Inclusion**: Ensure minority political voices and perspectives are represented in AI personas and political scenarios.

**Authenticity**: Minority political positions should be portrayed authentically rather than tokenistically.

**Agency**: Minority characters should have complex motivations and political positions rather than single-issue focus.

### Player Protection Measures

#### Age Appropriateness
**Teen Rating**: Content suitable for players 13+ with political interest and basic civic education.

**Educational Framing**: Present political conflict as democratic debate rather than personal warfare.

**Complexity Acknowledgment**: Acknowledge that real political issues are complex without promoting relativism about democratic values.

#### Mental Health Considerations

### Legal Compliance Framework

#### Free Speech Balance
