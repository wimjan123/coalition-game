# COALITION - Dutch Political System & Gamification

## Dutch Political Institutions and Processes

### Electoral System and Parliament

#### Tweede Kamer (House of Representatives)
- **150 seats** filled through **party-list proportional representation**
- **4-year terms** with elections typically in March
- **D'Hondt system** for seat allocation creating highly proportional results
- **Electoral threshold**: Effectively 0.67% (1 seat out of 150)
- **Result**: Typically 10-13 parties represented, largest party rarely exceeds 30-35 seats

#### Eerste Kamer (Senate)
- **75 members** elected by provincial councils and electoral colleges
- **4-year terms** staggered with different election timing than Tweede Kamer
- **Review function**: Can reject but not amend legislation passed by Tweede Kamer
- **Coalition mathematics**: Government must also secure Senate majority for legislation

#### Government Formation Process
**Phase 1: Verkenner (Scout)**
- Appointed immediately after elections to assess coalition possibilities
- Conducts initial talks with party leaders
- Reports on feasible coalition combinations
- Duration: 1-2 weeks

**Phase 2: Informateur**
- Appointed to facilitate specific coalition negotiations
- Mediates between parties on policy and portfolios
- May be multiple sequential informateurs if talks fail
- Duration: 4-12 weeks (recent formations taking 200+ days)

**Phase 3: Formateur**
- Usually the prospective Prime Minister
- Finalizes cabinet composition and detailed agreements
- Presents complete cabinet to Parliament
- Duration: 2-4 weeks
