# Feature Specification: COALITION UI Spec Review and Split Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `002-review-existing-coalition`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Review existing COALITION UI spec for potential split into multiple features"

## Analysis Summary

**Recommendation**: **Split the monolithic spec into 5 focused feature specifications**

The existing 418-line COALITION UI specification covers too many distinct functional areas that can be developed, tested, and validated independently. Splitting will improve development velocity, reduce integration complexity, and enable parallel workstreams.

## Current Spec Analysis

### Scope Assessment
The existing spec covers **7 major functional areas**:
1. **Desktop Shell Foundation** (Infrastructure)
2. **Social Feed System** (AI-driven social media simulation)
3. **Coalition Builder** (Political negotiation mechanics)
4. **News Feed & Media** (Multi-perspective journalism simulation)
5. **Debate Stage** (3D immersive political events)
6. **Messages & Communication** (Coalition partner interaction)
7. **Polls & Data Dashboard** (Analytics and polling visualization)

### Complexity Indicators
- **26 Functional Requirements** spanning multiple domains
- **80+ cross-references** to repository documentation
- **Multiple UI paradigms**: 2D desktop apps, 3D debate environment, real-time social media
- **Complex integration dependencies** between all systems
- **Different technical challenges**: Window management, AI integration, 3D rendering, real-time data

### Development Dependencies
**Critical Path Analysis:**
1. Desktop Shell í All Apps (blocking dependency)
2. Social Feed î News Feed (bidirectional integration)
3. Coalition Builder î Messages (negotiation workflows)
4. Debate Stage í All Systems (post-event integration)
5. Polls & Data ê All Systems (universal feedback consumer)

## Recommended Split Structure

### Spec 1: Desktop Shell Foundation
**Branch**: `003-feature-desktop-shell`
**Scope**: Core desktop environment infrastructure
**Dependencies**: None (foundation layer)

**Content:**
- Satirical OS shell with taskbar and wallpaper system
- Window management for political apps
- Notification center for crises and breaking news
- Time progression system (weekly electoral cycles)
- Save/load game state infrastructure

**Why Separate**: Foundation requirement for all other features; pure infrastructure work different from gameplay features

**Size Estimate**: ~8 functional requirements, 2-3 week implementation

### Spec 2: Social Feed & AI Personas
**Branch**: `004-feature-social-feed`
**Scope**: Twitter-like social media with AI-driven responses
**Dependencies**: Desktop Shell

**Content:**
- 9 AI persona types with authentic Dutch political voices
- Storm mechanics (Calm í Brewing í Storm í Crisis)
- Timeline interface with accessibility features
- Impact tracking (Followers, Momentum, Legitimacy)
- Integration hooks for news and polling systems

**Why Separate**: Complex AI integration requiring specialized skills; can be developed/tested independently; distinct user interaction paradigm

**Size Estimate**: ~6 functional requirements, 4-5 week implementation

### Spec 3: Coalition Builder & Political Mechanics
**Branch**: `005-feature-coalition-builder`
**Scope**: Core Dutch coalition formation simulation
**Dependencies**: Desktop Shell

**Content:**
- 150-seat Tweede Kamer mathematics with D'Hondt calculations
- Party compatibility matrix with ideological positioning
- Portfolio trading and ministry allocation system
- Red lines and deal-breaker warnings
- Coalition stability tracking algorithms

**Why Separate**: Complex political domain logic requiring expert validation; mathematical algorithms different from UI work; core gameplay mechanic

**Size Estimate**: ~5 functional requirements, 3-4 week implementation

### Spec 4: News Feed & Media Simulation
**Branch**: `006-feature-news-feed`
**Scope**: Multi-perspective journalism and media framing
**Dependencies**: Desktop Shell, Social Feed integration hooks

**Content:**
- Four frame types (Sympathetic, Critical, Sensational, Dismissive)
- Dutch media outlet simulation (NOS, RTL, Volkskrant, Telegraaf)
- Event clustering and story development
- Cross-references to social media influence
- "Why this matters" explanatory content

**Why Separate**: Complex media simulation logic; requires cultural/journalistic expert validation; integrates with but doesn't block other systems

**Size Estimate**: ~4 functional requirements, 2-3 week implementation

### Spec 5: Debate Stage & 3D Events
**Branch**: `007-feature-debate-stage`
**Scope**: Immersive 3D political debate environments
**Dependencies**: Desktop Shell, integration with all other systems

**Content:**
- 3D debate environment with Tweede Kamer or TV studio settings
- Speech choice system with style selectors
- Live reaction visualization and micro-polling
- Clip risk tracking and viral moment detection
- Post-debate integration across all systems

**Why Separate**: Completely different technical domain (3D vs 2D); requires specialized 3D development skills; high integration complexity suggests later development

**Size Estimate**: ~4 functional requirements, 4-6 week implementation

## Integration Strategy

### Shared Components
**Common Infrastructure** (in Desktop Shell spec):
- Event system for cross-app communication
- Political data models (parties, personas, relationships)
- Time progression and electoral cycle management
- Notification and crisis alert systems

### Integration Points
**Defined Interface Contracts:**
- Social Feed í News Feed: Storm events trigger news coverage
- Coalition Builder í Messages: Negotiation workflows and relationship updates
- Debate Stage í All: Post-event impact distribution across systems
- News Feed í Polls: Framing effects on public opinion
- All Systems í Polls: Aggregate impact on approval ratings

### Development Sequence
**Phase 1** (Parallel): Desktop Shell + Coalition Builder
**Phase 2** (Parallel): Social Feed + News Feed
**Phase 3** (Integration): Debate Stage with full system integration
**Phase 4** (Polish): Messages app and cross-system workflows

## Benefits of Splitting

### Development Velocity
- **Parallel Development**: 3-4 workstreams instead of 1 monolithic effort
- **Specialized Skills**: Match developers to appropriate technical domains
- **Faster Iteration**: Individual features can be prototyped and tested independently
- **Reduced Complexity**: Each spec ~80-120 lines vs 418-line monolith

### Quality & Validation
- **Expert Review**: Political mechanics vs AI vs 3D can be validated by appropriate experts
- **User Testing**: Individual apps can be tested for usability before integration
- **Technical Risk**: Isolate complex domains (AI, 3D) from core functionality
- **Cultural Review**: Social/News content can be reviewed separately from political mechanics

### Project Management
- **Clear Ownership**: Each spec can have dedicated owner and timeline
- **Milestone Clarity**: Deliverable apps vs one massive integration milestone
- **Risk Management**: Delay in 3D debate stage doesn't block social media development
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Progress visible in individual functional areas

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option 1: Keep Monolithic
**Rejected Because:**
- 418 lines too complex for single development workstream
- Mixes infrastructure, gameplay, AI, and 3D concerns
- Single point of failure for entire UI system
- Difficult to validate with domain experts

### Option 2: Split by Technical Domain (2D vs 3D vs AI)
**Rejected Because:**
- Breaks logical feature boundaries
- Creates artificial dependencies between business domains
- Harder for stakeholders to understand progress

### Option 3: Split by User Workflow (Campaign vs Formation vs Governing)
**Rejected Because:**
- All features needed across multiple workflow phases
- Creates duplicate technical infrastructure
- Doesn't align with natural development/testing boundaries

## Implementation Timeline

### Sequential Dependencies
```
