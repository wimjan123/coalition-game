# SM-003: AI Persona Response Engine

**Branch**: `feat/ai-personas`
**Domain**: Social Media
**Estimate**: 8 days
**Priority**: P1

## Goal
Generate authentic political responses from Dutch AI personas.

## Scope
- 9 distinct persona types with authentic Dutch political voices
- Response generation based on post content and political context
- Relationship tracking affecting response tone
- Response timing variation (immediate to delayed)
- Rule-based fallback when AI unavailable

## Out of Scope
- Real-time LLM integration (offline-first)
- Learning from player behavior
- Custom persona creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each persona generates responses consistent with their political archetype
- Response tone varies based on relationship with player
- Responses appear within 2-5 seconds of player posts
- Rule-based responses work when offline
- Personas maintain voice consistency across interactions
- Cultural accuracy validated by Dutch political experts

## Dependencies
None (core AI system)

## Interfaces
**Events Published:**
- `PersonaResponse(persona_id, post_id, response_content, tone)`
- `RelationshipUpdated(persona_id, change_amount)`

**Events Consumed:**

## Traceability
