**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Purpose**: Risk assessment and optimal build sequencing for 22 micro-features

## Top Development Risks

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risks

#### R1: AI Response Quality & Cultural Authenticity
**Affected Features**: SM-003 (AI Personas), all features requiring Dutch political accuracy
**Risk Level**: High
**Impact**: Could undermine entire game's educational and satirical value
