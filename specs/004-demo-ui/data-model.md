## Relationships & Derived Data
- `meter_effects` fields across entities feed into `MeterFeedback.gd` to calculate copy variants.
- Social feed consumes personas filtered by `tags_supported`; persona replies escalate when linked meter snapshot marks `is_critical`.
- Calendar reminders schedule toasts and docking badges when `week_index` approaches an event's `week` minus one.
- Debate outcomes push new headlines and social tags, ensuring telemetry logs capture both the answer taken and downstream copy triggers.
