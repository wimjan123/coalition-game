**Structure**: Goal, Scope, Acceptance, Dependencies, Interfaces, Traceability, Risks

### 5.  RISKS_AND_SEQUENCE.md
**Location**: `/home/wvisser/political-game/specs/RISKS_AND_SEQUENCE.md`
**Content**: Risk assessment and optimal build sequencing
- **Critical Risks**: AI cultural authenticity, 3D performance, integration complexity
- **4-Stream Development Model**: UI/UX, Political Domain, AI Integration, Systems
- **18-week phased approach** with risk mitigation at each stage

## Key Achievements

### Parallel Development Enabled
- **4-5 concurrent streams** vs 1 monolithic development
- **30% faster delivery**: 16 weeks parallel vs 23 weeks sequential
- **Clear ownership**: Each micro-feature has focused responsibility
- **Independent testing**: Features can be validated separately

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Cultural authenticity**: Dutch political expert validation workflow
- **Technical complexity**: 3D performance gates and 2D fallbacks
- **Integration issues**: Interface-first development with event bus
- **Scope management**: P0/P1/P2 priority system with Extension features

### Quality Assurance Framework
- **Political accuracy**: Expert review at each milestone
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all features
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Ongoing Dutch cultural advisory board
- **Performance standards**: 60+ FPS, <5s AI responses, <200ms UI

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development teams can work on independent micro-features while maintaining system integration through well-defined event contracts and data schemas.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** 22 micro-features defined with clear boundaries
   **When** development teams work in parallel streams
   **Then** Features integrate seamlessly through event contracts

2. **Given** Political domain complexity requiring expert validation
   **When** Cultural advisory board reviews Dutch authenticity
   **Then** Political accuracy maintained across all features

3. **Given** Risk mitigation strategies for critical technical challenges
   **When** 3D performance issues or AI authenticity problems arise
   **Then** Fallback plans prevent project delays or quality compromises

4. **Given** 16-20 week development timeline with milestone structure
   **When** Teams follow phased approach with integration checkpoints
   **Then** Complete political simulation delivered with authentic Dutch experience
