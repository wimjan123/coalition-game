## Game Theme & Tone
- Serious political realism with satirical, darkly humorous undertones
- Think "Borgen meets Yes Minister"
- Desktop OS simulation provides immersive political environment
- Educational value through authentic Dutch political system simulation

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Discovery and planning complete
- **Development Stage**: Pre-implementation (design and documentation complete)
- **Next Steps**: Technical prototyping of desktop interface and coalition mechanics

## Key Features
1. **Desktop Simulation Interface**: Satirical OS shell with political apps, messaging, coalition talks
